Devred-PE-2014
==============

A small experiment around the [Spring-Summer 2014 Devred Collection](http://www.devred.com/looks-saison-4893.r.html). The motivation behind this application was to develop a list view that can be used over another component that need touch events, like a [MapView](http://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapView.html) or a [PhotoView](https://github.com/chrisbanes/PhotoView).
